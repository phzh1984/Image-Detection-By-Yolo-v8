# Image-Detection-By-Yolo-v8

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm that's used in computer vision. It's designed to detect and recognize objects in images or video frames. YOLO breaks down the task of object detection into a single neural network that simultaneously predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.

the general steps for image detection using YOLO:

Network Architecture: YOLO uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as its base architecture. The network is trained on a large dataset with annotated images.

Bounding Box Prediction: YOLO divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. Each bounding box contains information about the object's location (x, y coordinates), width, height, and a confidence score.

Class Prediction: YOLO predicts the probability distribution for each class within each bounding box.

Non-Maximum Suppression: To avoid duplicate detections, a post-processing step called non-maximum suppression is applied. This step removes redundant bounding boxes based on their confidence scores.

Output: The final output provides a list of bounding boxes, each associated with a class label and a confidence score.

To use YOLO for image detection, you typically need to follow these steps:

Pre-trained Models: YOLO models are often pre-trained on large datasets. You can use a pre-trained model for general object detection or fine-tune it on a specific dataset for your task.

Image Input: Provide an input image to the YOLO model.

Inference: Run the image through the YOLO model to obtain predictions.

Post-Processing: Apply non-maximum suppression to filter out redundant bounding boxes.

Visualization: Optionally, visualize the detected objects and their bounding boxes on the original image.
